# REDTOP_simulations
Codes and analysis plots
This is one file that I worked on to simulate the dynamics millions of particles particles in the environment of detector.
My task was to project position of photon hit on dodecagonal detector surface  on to a plane normal to the trajectory of 
of the impinging particle. The positions of projected hits generated Cerenkov ring. That paramters of rings could be used
to measure the energy, moementum, charge etc of the impinging particle. Those values can be compared with the known value
of the particles used for simulation. Many approximations were taken for position of the particle where particle started to
generate photon cone and energy resolution was determined. This .java file is just one of many files and plots are showing
typical outputs.
