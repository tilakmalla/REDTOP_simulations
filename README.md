# REDTOP_simulations
Codes and analysis plots
This is one of many files that I worked on to simulate the dynamics millions of particles particles in the environment of
the REDTOP detector.My task was to project position of photon hit on dodecagonal detector surface  on to a plane normal to the trajectory of the impinging particle. The positions of projected hits gives Cerenkov ring. Eventually, the paramters of rings could be used to measure the energy, moementum, charge etc of the impinging particle. Those values can be compared with the known value of the particles used for simulation. Many approximations were taken for position of the particle where particle started to generate photon cone and energy resolution was determined. This .java file is just one of many files and plots are showing typical outputs.
